Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. <br>
  Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio <br>
  of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.<br>

India has made progress in increasing the attainment rate of primary education. In 2011, Approximately 75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10 years, was literate.<br> India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.Much of the progress, especially in higher education and <br> scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrollment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a <br> 
  gross enrollment ratio of 24% in 2013, there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations, a <br>challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.<br>

At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the<br> 6 to 14 age group.[9] Certain post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but is <br> projected to be a US$40 billion market.<br>

In January 2019, India had over 900 universities and 40,000 colleges.[16] In India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action<br>  policies for the historically disadvantaged Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. In universities, colleges, and similar <br>institutions affiliated to the federal government, there is a maximum 50% of reservations applicable to these disadvantaged groups, at the state level it can vary. Maharashtra had <br>73% reservation in 2014, which is the highest percentage of reservations in India.<br>
