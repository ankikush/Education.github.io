A trail of developments mark the significant changes that took place over the years in shaping up the Board to its present status. U P Board of High School and 
  Intermediate Education was the first Board set up in 1921. It has under its jurisdiction Rajputana, Central India and Gwalior. In response to the representation 
  made by the Government of United Provinces, the then Government of India suggested to set up a joint Board in 1929 for all the areas which was named as the 'Board 
  of High School and Intermediate Education, Rajputana'. This included Ajmer, Merwara, Central India and Gwalior. 

The Board witnessed rapid growth and expansion at the level of Secondary education resulting in improved quality and standard of education in institutions. 
  But with the advent of State Universities and State Boards in various parts of the country the jurisdiction of the Board was confined only to Ajmer, Bhopal 
  and Vindhya Pradesh later. As a result of this, in 1952, the constitution of the Board was amended wherein its jurisdiction was extended to part-C and Part-D 
  territories and the Board was given its present name 'Central Board of Secondary Education'. It was in the year 1962 finally that the Board was reconstituted. 
  The main objectives were to serve the educational institutions more effectively, to be responsive to the educational needs of those students whose parents were 
  employed in the Central Government and had frequently transferable jobs.
